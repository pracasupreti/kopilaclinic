    **Key Components:**
    • Blood pressure monitoring
    • Weight tracking
    • Fetal heartbeat assessment
    • Ultrasound scans
    • Blood and urine tests
    
    **Recommended Schedule:**
    - Monthly until 28 weeks
    - Biweekly until 36 weeks
    - Weekly until delivery
    
    These visits help detect complications like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restrictions early.`,

The growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus can block or distort the fallopian tubes, preventing eggs from being fertilized or reaching the uterus. It can also lead to the formation of ovarian cysts, which may reduce egg quality, and cause scar tissue or adhesions, disrupting the normal function of the ovaries and uterus. These factors can make it more difficult to conceive, though many women with endometriosis still manage to get pregnant with or without treatment.",
